My personal notes for learning Prompt Engineering

## What is Prompt Engineering?
**Prompt engineering** is the practice of designing, refining, and optimizing input queries, known as prompts, to elicit desired responses from AI language models like OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Bard, and others. This practice is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of AI in various applications, from automated content generation to complex decision-making processes.
